# The Argonauts

>"I was so happy renting in New York City for so long because renting--or at least the way I rented, which involves never lifting a finger to better my surroundings--allows you to let things literally fall apart all around you. Then, when it gets to be too much, you just move on." (p. 12)

>"But any fixed claim on realness, especially when it is tied to an identity, also has a finger in psychosis." (p. 14)

Quoting Judith Butler:
>"The bad reading [of *Gender Trouble*] goes something like this: I can get up in the morning, look in my closet, and decide which gender I want to be today. I can take out a piece of clothing and change my gender: stylize it, and then that evening I can change it again and be something radically other, so that what you get is something like the commodification of gender, and the understanding of taking on gender as a kind of consumerism...When my whole point was that the very formation of subjects, the very formation of persons, *presupposes* gender in a certain way--that gender is not to be chosen and that "performativity" is not radical choice and it's not voluntarism...Performativity has to do with repetition, very often with the repetition of oppressive and painful gender norms to force them to resignify. This is not freedom, but a question of how to work the trap that one is inevitably in." (p. 15)

Following Prop 8's passage in California:
>"We were surprised at our shock, as it revealed a passive, naive trust that the arc of the moral universe, however long, tends toward justice." (p. 23)

>"Perhaps its the word *radical* that needs rethinking. But what could we angle ourselves toward instead, or in addition? Openness? Is that good enough, strong enough? You're *the only one who knows when you're uisng things to protect yourself and keep your ego together and when you're opening and letting things fall apart, letting the world come as it is--working with it rather than struggling against it. You're the only one who knows (Pema Chödrön)*. And the thing is, even you don't always know." (p. 27)

>"Wayne Koestenbaum tells an instructive story on this account: 'Some psycho girlfriend of mine (decades ago!) answered a long, rhapsodic letter I'd written her with this terse, humiliating rebuff: 'Next time, write to me.' That one command, on a tiny slip of paper, tucked into an envelope. I remember thinkng, 'Wasn't I writing to her? How could I know, when writing to her, that I secretly wasn't writing to her?' At that point, Derrida hadn't yet written *The Post Card*, so I didn't know what to do with my befuddled, wounded sense of being a rhapsodic narcissit of a letter-writer weirdly instructed to 'relate,' to speak to someone instead of the nothingness at the end of writing.' (p. 46)

>"And now, after living beside you all these years, and watching your wheel of a mind bring foth an art of pure wildness--as I labor grimly on these sentences, wondering all the while if prose if but the gravestone marking forsaking of wildness (fidelity to sense-making, to assertion, to *argument*, however loose)--I'm not sure which of us is more at home in the world, which of us is more free." (p. 52) 

>"They were frustrated by the poststructuralist ethos of her teaching, they were tired of dismantling identities, tired of hearing that the most resistance one could muster in a Foucauldian universe was to work the trap one is inevitably in." (p. 59)

>"It has been political important for feminists to underplay the erotics of childbearing in order to make space for erotics elsewhere (i.e., "I fuck to come, not to conceive"), but *Puppies and Babies* eschews such cleavage. Instead we get all the messy, raucous perversities to be found in both pregant and nonpregnant bodies..." (p. 72)

>"Homonormativity seems to be me to be a natural consequence of the decriminalization of homosexuality: once something is no longer illicit, punishable, pathologized, or used as a lawful basis for raw discrimination or acts of violence, that phenomenonw will no longer be able to represent or deliver on subversion, the subcultural, the underground, the fridge, in the same way" (p. 73)

>"But as Opie here implies, it's the bimary of normative/transgressive that's unsustainble, along with the demand that anyone live a life that's all one thing." (p. 74)

>"We bantered good-naturedly, yet somehow allowed ourselves to get polarized into a needless binary. That's what we both hate about fiction, or at lease crappy fiction--it purports to provide occasions for thinking through complex issues, but really it has predetermined the positions, stuffed a narrative full of false choices, and hooked you on them, rendering you less able to see out, to *get* out." (p. 82)

>"Visibility makes possible, but it also disciplines: disciplines gender, disciplines genre" (p. 86)

>"Babies grow in a helix of hope and fear; genstating draws one but deeper into the spiral. It isn't cruel in there, but it's dark." (p. 92)\

>"Remnant Lacanian that she is, Silverman's apperture does not seem wide enough to inclue an enjoyment that doesn't derive from filling a void, or love that is not merely balm for a wound. **So far as I can tell, most worthwhile pleasures on this earth slip between gratifying another and gratifying oneself. Some would call that an ethics.**" (p. 96)

>"Afraid of assertion. Always trying to get out of "totalizing" language, i.e., language that rides roughshod over specificity; realizing this is another form of paranoia." (p. 98)"

>"*One only has to read interviews with outstanding women to hear them apologizing* (Monique Wittig). But I don't intend to denigrate the power of apology: I keep in my *sorry* when I really mean it. And certainly there are many speakers whom I'd like to see do more trembling, more unknowing, more apologizing." (p. 98)

>"Rather than philosopher or a pluralizer, I may be more of an empiricist, insofar as my *aim is not to rediscover the eternal or the universal, but to find the conditions under which something new is produced.* (Deleuze/Parnet)" (p. 102)

>"The pleasure of recognitizng that one may have to undergo the same realizations, write the same notes in the margin, return to the same themes in one's work, relearn the same emotional truths, write the same book over and over again--not because one is stupid or obstinate or incapable of change, but because such revisitations constitute a life." (p. 112)

>"*The mother of an adult child sees her work completed and undone at the same time* (Eula Biss). If this holds true, I may have to withstand not only rage, but also my undoing." (p. 140)

*** A Review by Eula Biss

>"What a dazzlingly generous, gloriously unpredictable book! Maggie Nelson shows us what it means to be real, offering a way of thinking that is as challenging as it is liberating. She invites us to 'pay homage to the transitive' and enjoy 'a becoming in which one never becomes'. Reading *The Argonauts* made me happier and freer."

## Big Questions 
- Does this idea of a life free of the chokehold of having to "arrive" or "become" something within a series of trap power dynamics make one "freer"? How are these (incredibly self-reflective) White women defining the word "free," and does a removal of the constraints of self-flaggelation put one closer to liberation?
- If this is the central thesis of the book, it's got some wild existentialist veins. Is that really true?
