# School Segregation and Law

## Slaughterhouse Cases *(1873)*
Discussion of the Fourteenth Amendment:
> one pervading purpose... [was] the freedom of the slave race, the security and firm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the newly made free-man and citizen from the oppressions of those who had formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him

## Plessy v. Ferguson *(1896)*


## Brown v. Board of Education *(1954)*

## Green v. New Kent County *(1968)*
Ordered school districts to eliminate segregation root and branch in all aspects of their public schools and to do so immediately *(Brown & Jackson, 2013, p. 10).*

- 1970, Nixon is elected. He gets 4 Supreme Court nominees by the end of the first term, and ~shocker~ it changes the tone of the court. 

## Griggs v. Duke Power Co. *(1971)*
Complaintant could establish a *prima facie* case of employment discrimination by establishing that a given employment policy or practice (e.g. requiring a high school diploma, passing a general intelligence test) produced a discriminatory effect. *(Brown & Jackson, 2013, p. 10).*

## Keyes v. School District No. 1 *(1973)*
Concludes that an unconstitutionally segregated school system was not one where the students attended racially identifiable schools, *de facto* segregation. Rather it was one where the racially identifiable schools resulted from **intentional conduct by school authorities directed toward segregating the schools**. *(Brown & Jackson, 2013, p. 10).*

## Milliken v. Bradley *(1974)*
Rejects a lower court's inter-district school desegregation plan in Detroit, rules that a school desegregation remedy was limited to the offending school system. *(Brown & Jackson, 2013, p. 10).* Essentially, this means that school districts in urban areas where white flight had occured could never remedy formal segregation. 

## Washington v. Davis *(1976)*
Undoes Griggs. Rejected the discriminatory effect as basis for determining unconstitutional discrimination, instead finds "only governmental actions motivated by discriminatory **intent** violated the Constitution." *(Brown & Jackson, 2013, p. 10).*

## Bakke v. Regents of the University of California *(1978)*
Court strikes down admissions practice at UC Davis Medical School for reserving 16 seats out of 100 for POC.

## City of Richmond v. Croson *(1989)*
Strikes down set-aside program for minority contracters in Richmond, VA
>For the first time in the 121-year history of the equal protection clause, a majority of the justices followed Justice Powell's proclamation: that the purpose of the equal protection clause was to protect the rights of individuals. As a result, the Court concluded that strict judicial scrutiny would apply to the use of racial classifications by state and local government entities, regardless of the race of the beneficiaries.
