# Handbook of Critical Race Theory in Education

## "The History and Conceptual Elements of Critical Race Theory"
This chapter quickly profiles some relevant case law around CRT in education,  describes CRT's development from CLS, and the evolutions of key concepts in CRT. Among these are victims vs. perpetrators perspective (Alan Freeman, 1978), unconscious bias and wrongful focus on intent versus injury in traditional legal discourse (Charles Lawrence, 1987), and interest convergence and racial realism (Derrick Bell, 1980). They also point out the use of storytelling and counter-narrativeas as methodologies of resistance.

On why CRT theorists had to break from CLS:
> For people of color, it was legal rights and their enforcement by the Supreme Court that led to the end of segregation, anti-discrimination legislation, and voting rights for people of color. (p. 13)

## "Discerning Critical Moments"
Delgado & Stefancic posit that CRT's work is in using critical concepts to conncet seemingly disconnected events, or "critical moments." They use a few fairly ovesimplistic examples of this, namely a discussion of Columbine's violence fueled by white flight.

On Columbine:
> "Unsuprisingly, the parents who had fled Denver in search of safety found the opposite for their children in the suburbs. Nor is Littleton unique. Practically every serial shooting has taken place in suburban schools that were all-white and highly competitive." (p. 27)

A weird assumption about these schools (especially given how much money these communities have:
> "Schools like Berkeley High School or [Santa Monica High School](http://www.samohi.smmusd.org/) in California, or Garfield in Seattle, with large numbers of minorities and kids from all classes, professor and banker families all the way to janitor and homeless families, are both academically excellent and multiracial. Few school shootings or serious mayhem take place in schools like these, because almost every kid is apt to have a peer group in which he or she feels secure." (p. 28)
