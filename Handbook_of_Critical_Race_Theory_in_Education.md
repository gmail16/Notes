## THE GENEALOPGY OF CRT AND CRT IN EDUCATION

###"The History and Conceptual Elements of Critical Race Theory"
This chapter quickly profiles some relevant case law around CRT in education,  describes CRT's development from CLS, and the evolutions of key concepts in CRT. Among these are victims vs. perpetrators perspective (Alan Freeman, 1978), unconscious bias and wrongful focus on intent versus injury in traditional legal discourse (Charles Lawrence, 1987), and interest convergence and racial realism (Derrick Bell, 1980). They also point out the use of storytelling and counter-narrativeas as methodologies of resistance.

On why CRT theorists had to break from CLS:
> For people of color, it was legal rights and their enforcement by the Supreme Court that led to the end of segregation, anti-discrimination legislation, and voting rights for people of color. (p. 13)

### "Discerning Critical Moments"
Delgado & Stefancic posit that CRT's work is in using critical concepts to conncet seemingly disconnected events, or "critical moments." They use a few fairly ovesimplistic examples of this, namely a discussion of Columbine's violence fueled by white flight and Latino & black labor. 

On Columbine:
> "Unsuprisingly, the parents who had fled Denver in search of safety found the opposite for their children in the suburbs. Nor is Littleton unique. Practically every serial shooting has taken place in suburban schools that were all-white and highly competitive." (p. 27)

A weird assumption about these schools (especially given how much money these communities have:
> "Schools like Berkeley High School or [Santa Monica High School](http://www.samohi.smmusd.org/) in California, or Garfield in Seattle, with large numbers of minorities and kids from all classes, professor and banker families all the way to janitor and homeless families, are both academically excellent and multiracial. Few school shootings or serious mayhem take place in schools like these, because almost every kid is apt to have a peer group in which he or she feels secure." (p. 28)

### "Critical Race Theory -- What It Is Not!"
Ladson-Billings revisits the history of CRT's entrance into education, wherein she and William Tate put forth the concepts to a group of scholars who were both excited and horrified by the idea that racism is normal, pervasive, and intractable from education policy, something very different from "diversity"-focused education. CRT, she posits, is made up of a few centrally-held commitments (among them race as normal and a social construct, intersectionality and anti-essentialism, and counterstorytelling). The article overall makes the point that use of CRT for things outside this paradigm, and especially for overly personal disections or criticisms, really aren't furthering CRT in education. 

Common questions about CRT: 
> "People were genuinely trying to understand what our analysis meant for the future of educational disparities. Were we saying that the inequities were intractable? Yes, we were. Were we saying that the civil rights movement was a failed project? To some extent it was. Were we saying that racism would endure? Indeed we were." (p. 35)

The Charlie Explanation:
>"While critical race theorists accept the scientific understanding of no-race or no genetic difference, we also accept the power of a social reality that allows for significant disparities in the life chances of people based on the categorical understanding of race" (p. 39)

Intersectionality in practice:
> "Rather than attempting to simplify and strip down to a single explanation, CRT scholarship is willing to engage in the "messiness" of real life...If someone is gay or lesbian, is his or her racial identity through into question? Is race or sex privileged? Are these indentities ever in conflict? These questions are a part of the work of CRT scholarship." (p. 40)

What "counterstory" is: 
>"Despite what story is presented to the public, the 'counter-story' is a contrastic story that describes the story from a different vantage point. The ability to tell that story is important not just as a defense strategy but also as a way to unmoor people from received truths so that they might consider alternatives" (p. 42)

What "counterstory" in CRT is NOT (according to GLB):
>"The point of storytelling is not to vent or rant or to be an exhibitionist regarding one's own racial struggle. Unfortunately, far too many would-be critical race theorists in education use the narrative or counter-story in just that way." (p. 42)

>"CRT scholars cannot rail against the failure of positivist research to be objective or neutral when our own scholarship is so specific to our personal concerns that it fails to help us grasp important principles of racial justice." (p. 44)

>"The work of the critical race scholar must be as rigorous as that of any other scholarship (or perhaps more so)." (p. 45)

Hochschild's (1984) "anomaly thesis" vs. "symbiosis thesis":
<dl>
    <dt>anomaly thesis</dt>
    <dd>"race discrimination is a terrible and inexplicable anomaly stuck in the middle of our liberal democratic ethos" (p. 3)</dd>
    <dt>symbiosis thesis</dt>
    <dd>racism's ongoing presence "is not simply an excresence on a fundamentally health liberal democratic body but is a part of what shapes and energizes the body" (p. 5); "liberal democracy and racism in the United States are historically, even inherently, reinforcing; American society as we know it exists only because of its foundation in racially based slavery, and it thrives only because racial discrimination continues" (p. 5)</dd>
</dl>

#### Questions Raised
- GLB says that scholars like Skiba & Rausch who document inequity and racial violence using quantitative methods would not call themselves CRT scholars. (p. 36) Can quantitative or archival work ever be considered CRT work?
- At what point is CRT scholarship "too personal" or too self-interested? This analysis surprised me. Outlining the many forms a systemic violence can occur strikes me as exactly CRT work, and while there is certainly a notable distinction between journaling or academic takedowns of personal affronts and useful scholarship, where is GLB suggesting that we draw these lines?

### "Critical Race Theory's Intellectual Roots: My Email Epistolary with Derrick Bell"
Solórzano and Bell discuss through a series of (fairly one-sided) exchanges the means through which CRT is connected to ethic and gender studies and Freirean pedagogy, along with questions about how canons are established and preserved (and how CRT fits within them). Solórzano mosty traces his geneaology of plugging CRT into education vis a vis Freirean transformational resistance theory, referencing heavily his work with Dolores Delgado-Bernal and Tara Yosso in LatCrit development. 

On the idea that CRT must be "reinvented" in education: 
>"In CRT in education we are often told that we must return to the legal foundations and tenetss of CRT. Although I feel that CRT in the law has been critical and foundational in CRT in education, I've tried to show how it also has foundational roots in race, ethnic and women's studies and Freirean critical pedagogy. I believe it is our responsibility to reinvent CRT for various fields and contexts in which it finds itself." (p. 57, Solórzano)

    <dd>"starts from the premise that all education is political and thus schools are never neutral institutions...schools either function to maintain and reproduce the existing social order or empower people to transform themselves and/or society...two-way dialogues of cooperation and action between the student and the teacher are the focus, content, and pedagogy of the classroom" (p. 53)</dd>

    <dd>"schools use the banking method to domesticate students and treat them as passive receptacles waiting for knowledge to be deposited by the teacher...the teacher communicates with the students in one-way monologues. This approach leads students to feel their thoughts and ideas are not important enough to warrant a two-way dialogue with the teacher" (p. 53)</dd>

### "Du Bois's Contributions to Critical Race Studies in Education" 
Rabaka makes the case that Du Bois collected work could be considered *classical CRT* in its foreshadowing explications of an intersectional, class-conscious idea of race and racism. Du Bois, she argues, is flattened into a counterpoint to Booker T. Washington within discussions aroud
